# The Fuck is Haskell?

A 

## Meaning of the above bullshit words?

## Functional

- All hail functions. Children of the idea behind lambda calculus. Use functions just like any other sort of values.

- Evaluate not execute.

## Pure

- Immutability is the key.

- Fuck all side-effects.

- Deterministic as fuck.

- Benefits: equational reasoning, parallelism, happiness

## Lazy

- Infinity? ez.

- Compositional programming â€” you feel like Mozart.

- Disadvantage: Wot is time? Wot is space?

## Haskell, the new cool guy in campus

## Types

- Statically typed: run time errors 

- Expressive: the code is the documentation

- Expressive: brings clarity into coding

## Abstraction

- Eat, Code, Sleep, 

- Think about the big picture and don't cry about some stupid exception.

## What can I do with it?

- Program Correctness (QuickCheck)

- Fail safe programming (Cardano)

- High-load concurrent programming (web back-end)
