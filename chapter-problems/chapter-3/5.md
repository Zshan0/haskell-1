Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class? When is it feasible?

Ans: Given an arbitrary function, f, we define a function f' which returns 1 on input n if f halts on input n. Now, for some number x we define a function g which, on input n, returns 1 if n = x, and otherwise calls f'(n).

If functional equivalence were decidable, then deciding whether g is identical to f' decides whether f halts on input x. That would solve the Halting problem. Related to this discussion is Rice's theorem.

If there are finitely many inputs in the domain, and both functions halt for all of them, and you have a decidable equality check for the codomain, then you just try both functions on all the inputs and compare the outputs.
